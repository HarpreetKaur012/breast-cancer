# Prediction of breast cancer

In this project on breast cancer prediction, we aim to compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models. We've utilized a diverse dataset containing clinical and histopathological features, ensuring balanced representation of malignant and benign tumors. After preprocessing the dataset, including feature selection and handling missing values, each model will be trained and evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy and AUC-ROC. For robustness and optimization, we have used hyperparameter tuningÂ and cross-validation. In order to enhance diagnostic and treatment outcomes, we aim to determine which breast cancer prediction model is the most successful. Dataset includes some important tumor visual attributes such as average radius, texture, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave spots, and perimeter along with the diagnosis label - Malignant or Benign for each patient.
